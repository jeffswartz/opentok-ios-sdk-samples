Project 5: Multi-Party Call
==================================

This project shows how to use OpenTok iOS SDK to develop a multi-party call (one
publisher, N subscribers with only one subscriber video enabled at a time).
By the end of a code review, you will learn how to add a multi-party call
with the OpenTok iOS SDK. This example also shows how to use archiving feature.


Application Notes
=================

1. This sample shows a publisher bar (bottom), subscriber bar (top) and  an
   archiving overlay.

2. The publisher bar has buttons for publisher's toggle camera and mute/unmute
   publisher's audio.
   
3. The subscriber bar has a button which allows subscriber to enable/disable
   audio.

4. Swipe right/left to navigate to the next/previous subscriber in the session.
