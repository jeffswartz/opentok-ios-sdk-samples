Project 6: Audio Levels
=======================

This project shows how to use the OpenTok iOS SDK to develop audio-only calls
with multiple subscribers and audio levels. By the end of a code review, you
should learn how to add audio only calls with OpenTok iOS SDK.

Application Notes
-----------------

1. This sample shows an audio-only session with audio level meters for each
   subscriber as well as for the publisher. This supports multiple audio-only
   subscribers.

2. It allows mute/unmute on both the publisher and on subscribers.
